		<h2>Foundations of Theoretical Neurocience</h2>
		<p>
			In Spring 2020, I'll be organizing a student seminar on the foundations of theoretical neuroscience.
			We'll begin by following the <a href="http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~lmate/biblio/dayanabbott.pdf">Dayan & Abbott (2003)</a> textbook, and then progress to papers and other resources.
			This is loosely inspired by the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mit-bcs-philosophy/home">MIT BCS Philosophy Circle</a>.
			Especially in the second half of the seminar, we will focus on <b>language processing</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Optional homework assignments are listed for each week, for those who are interested in implementing models and solving some math problems. [Update 1/22/20: links to these homeworks are currently missing, and we are attempting to recover them.]
		</p>
		<p>Contact me if you're interested: <span class="email"></span></p>
