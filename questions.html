			<h1>Research Questions</h1>
		</div>
		Here is a list of research questions I find interesting. Broadly, these questions involve a combination of computation, cognitive science, and linguistics. If you're interested in collaborating or have thoughts on these problems, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:nicholas_tomlin@brown.edu">nicholas_tomlin@brown.edu</a>.
		<ol>
			<li>How can computational linguistics benefit from modeling hierarchical structure? Are <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/icml11-ParsingWithRecursiveNeuralNetworks.pdf">TreeRNNs</a> a viable solution? How should we define our parse trees, and can they be learned in tandem with the semantics?</li>
			<li>How should we structure meaning representations? Can meaning be learned functionally, e.g., through reinforcement learning?</li>
			<li>How does sentence meaning contribute to knowledge representation? One idea is to define the world in terms of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process">POMDP</a>, and use language to update the belief state. But then how do we represent possible world states (i.e., latent states of the POMDP)?</li>
