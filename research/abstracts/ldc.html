		<h2>LingView: a Web Interface for Viewing FLEx and ELAN Files</h2>
		<p>Kalinda Pride, Nicholas Tomlin, Scott AnderBois</p>
		<p class="abstract">
			<b>Abstract:</b> This article presents LingView, a web interface for viewing FLEx and ELAN files, optionally time-synced with corresponding audio or video files. While FLEx and ELAN are useful tools for many linguists, the resulting annotated files are often inaccessible to the general public. Here, we describe a data pipeline for combining FLEx and ELAN files into a single JSON format which can be displayed on the web. While this software was originally built as part of the A'ingae Language Documention Project to display a corpus of materials in A'ingae, the software was designed to be a flexible resource for a variety of different communities, researchers, and materials.
